Version One Task Burner
=======================

Chrome plugin for users of Version One (agile project management platform). Users can quickly see which backlog they are working on, their tasks in progress and can burn down tasks and set them to complete. 

User must be logged into Version One in the browser session as the plugin does not store any sensitive data.
